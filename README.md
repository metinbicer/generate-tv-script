## Overview
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree course project on RNN text generation.

# About
TV scripts are generated using RNNs based on [Senfield dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv).

# Steps
1. Lookup tables are created for word embeddings
2. Punctiation tokenizer function is created
3. Words are batched in for a given sizes of sequence and batch
4. LSTM network is created
5. A function to process the data for one step is created

# Dependencies
1. pytorch
2. numpy
